Here at the Data Science program we recommend VS Code or PyCharm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick Your Coding Home Wisely!\n\n\n\nYour IDE is like your favorite coffee shop‚Äîyou‚Äôll spend a lot of time there. So choose one that feels comfortable to you!\n\n\n\n3.1 Download an IDE\n\nVS CodePyCharm\n\n\n\nGo to the VS Code Website\n\n\n\nOpen your browser and visit https://code.visualstudio.com.\n\nClick ‚ÄúDownload for Windows‚Äù or ‚ÄúDownload for macOS‚Äù based on your system.\n\n\nInstall VS Code\n\n\n\nWindows: Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation instructions.\n\nmacOS: Open the .zip file and move Visual Studio Code to the Applications folder.\n\n\nVerify Installation\n\n\n\nOpen VS Code and check if it runs correctly.\n\n\n\n\nGo to the PyCharm Website\n\n\n\nVisit https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download.\n\nSelect either Community Edition (free) or Professional Edition (paid).\n\nClick Download for Windows or macOS.\n\n\nInstall PyCharm\n\n\n\nWindows: Run the .exe installer and follow the instructions.\n\nmacOS: Open the .dmg file and drag PyCharm to the Applications folder.\n\n\nVerify Installation\n\n\n\nOpen PyCharm and create a new Python project to ensure it‚Äôs working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Connect IDE to GitHub Account\n\nVS CodePyCharm\n\n\n\nInstall GitHub Extension in VS Code\n\n\n\nOpen VS Code.\n\nGo to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X).\n\nSearch for ‚ÄúGitHub Pull Requests and Issues‚Äù and install it.\n\n\nSign In to GitHub\n\n\n\nOpen VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P).\n\nSearch for ‚ÄúGitHub: Sign in to GitHub‚Äù and select it.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions to authenticate with GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nSign In to GitHub from PyCharm\n\n\n\nOpen PyCharm and go to ‚ÄúFile &gt; Settings (Windows)‚Äù / ‚ÄúPyCharm &gt; Preferences (Mac)‚Äù.\n\nNavigate to ‚ÄúVersion Control &gt; GitHub‚Äù.\n\nClick Add Account and sign in using your GitHub credentials or a personal access token.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Extensions/Plugins\n\nExtensions (or plugins) are add-ons that enhance functionality, such as adding language support, debugging tools, or AI-powered coding assistance. They help customize the IDE to improve productivity, automation, and development workflows.\n\n\nVS Code: ExtensionsPyCharm: Plugins\n\n\n\nPython\nAdds Python support, IntelliSense, debugging, and Jupyter Notebook functionality.\nR\nProvides language support for R, including syntax highlighting and code completion.\nPylance\nOffers advanced linting, type checking, and autocomplete features for Python.\nGit\nProvides Git integration for version control within VS Code.\nGitHub\nAllows you to manage and interact with GitHub repositories directly from VS Code.\nCode Runner\nEnables you to run code snippets for multiple languages, including Python, directly within VS Code.\nJupyter\nLets you run and edit Jupyter Notebooks directly in VS Code.\nEditCSV\nAllows for easy editing of CSV files directly within VS Code.\nHTML Preview\nProvides an HTML preview of your code directly in the editor.\nQuarto\nProvides support for creating and rendering Quarto documents within VS Code.\nRemote - SSH\nAllows you to open remote folders and develop on remote machines over SSH.\nTensorBoard\nEnables the viewing of TensorFlow logs directly within VS Code.\nSVG Preview\nLets you preview SVG files within VS Code.\nCopilot (Paid)\nA paid extension by GitHub that provides AI-powered code suggestions and autocompletions.\nMarkdown All in One\nOffers a comprehensive suite of features for editing and previewing Markdown files.\nDocker\nAdds Docker support to VS Code, allowing you to manage containers and images.\n\n\n\n\nKey Promoter X\nDisplays keyboard shortcuts every time you use the mouse, helping you learn and use shortcuts more efficiently.\nMarkdown Navigator\nProvides enhanced markdown editing and previewing support.\nR Plugin\nAdds support for R scripts and notebooks, allowing you to work with R code directly in PyCharm.\n.env Files Support\nLoads environment variables from .env files, helping you manage sensitive information like API keys and credentials.\nPandas Helper\nProvides quick previews, descriptions, and structure analysis for Pandas DataFrames, making it easier to inspect data.\nDeepBugs\nUses machine learning to detect common Python coding mistakes and bugs in your code.\nDocker\nAdds Docker support to PyCharm, allowing you to manage containers, images, and other Docker resources directly from the IDE.\nJupyter\nProvides full Jupyter Notebook support in PyCharm, including the ability to run and edit notebooks.\nGitHub\nIntegrates GitHub repositories and allows you to work with your projects directly from PyCharm.\nPython Scientific\nAdds support for scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, helping you visualize and analyze data.\nTabnine\nAn AI-powered code completion tool, improving your coding speed by suggesting relevant completions.\nPython Docstring Generator\nHelps you generate consistent Python docstrings with a single shortcut, saving time on documentation.\nDatabase Navigator\nProvides easy database connection, navigation, and management capabilities within PyCharm.\nFlake8\nAdds linting support for Python, helping you maintain clean and readable code by checking for errors and style issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Debugger\n\nA debugger is a tool that helps find and fix errors in code by allowing step-by-step execution, breakpoints, and variable inspection. It makes troubleshooting easier by showing how code runs in real time.\n\n\nVS CodePyCharm\n\n\n\nSet Breakpoints\n\n\n\nClick on the gutter (the area next to the line numbers) to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear where the breakpoint is set.\n\n\nOpen the Debug Panel\n\n\n\nPress Ctrl+Shift+D (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+D (macOS) to open the Debug Panel.\n\n\nConfigure the Debugger\n\n\n\nIf this is your first time using the debugger, you may need to create a launch configuration.\nClick on ‚Äúcreate a launch.json file‚Äù in the Debug Panel.\nSelect Python from the dropdown and VS Code will generate the default configuration for you.\n\n\nStart Debugging\n\n\n\nClick the green play button or press F5 to start debugging. Your code will run, and the debugger will stop at any breakpoints.\n\n\nUse Debugging Controls\n\n\n\nStep Over (F10): Executes the next line of code without stepping into functions.\nStep Into (F11): Steps into the code inside a function if the line contains a function call.\nStep Out (Shift+F11): Steps out of the current function and back to the caller.\nContinue (F5): Continues running the program until the next breakpoint.\nVariables: View and edit variables in the Debug panel.\nWatch: Add expressions to track their values in real-time.\n\n\n\n\nSet Breakpoints\n\n\n\nClick on the gutter (next to line numbers) to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear at the breakpoint.\n\n\nOpen the Debug Tool Window\n\n\n\nTo open the Debug Tool Window, go to View &gt; Tool Windows &gt; Debug, or use the shortcut Alt+5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+5 (macOS).\n\n\nStart Debugging\n\n\n\nClick on the bug icon or press Shift+F9 to start debugging. Your program will run, and it will stop at breakpoints.\n\n\nUse Debugging Controls\n\n\n\nStep Over (F8): Executes the next line of code without stepping into functions.\nStep Into (F7): Steps into the function being called.\nStep Out (Shift+F8): Steps out of the current function.\nResume Program (F9): Continues execution until the next breakpoint.\nVariables: View and edit variables in the Variables tab.\nWatches: Add custom expressions to evaluate while debugging.\n\n\nView and Edit Variables\n\n\n\nIn the Debug tool window, under the Variables tab, you can inspect the values of variables in your current scope.\nYou can also right-click on variables to change their values at runtime, allowing you to test different scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there you go!  You‚Äôre officially all set up and ready to rock the tech world! Your tools are now in place, and all that‚Äôs left is for you to conquer the code, debug like a pro, and maybe even break a few things (just so you can fix them, of course). Go ahead, show the world what you‚Äôre made of‚Äîyour computer‚Äôs ready, and so are you! Keep calm and code on! üòéüöÄ",
